     I'm Anthony! I am a college student studying business, communication and digital media! As a Saint Louis native, I love toasted ravioli and gooey butter cake, though I dishonor my town with little knowledge of baseball. I enjoy boxing, reading books, and writing. I am not sure what I want to do in the future, but I want to get involved in business. I know coding is an essential skill, so I thought this would be a good place to start! I love to learn new things and am eager to take this course. I also love hiking and the great outdoors. Every year or two my dad and I go backpacking in the wilderness. I am starting a sales job right now, and hope to gain important skills from that and my classes for the future. I hope to live somewhere snowy and in the mountains, perhaps Colorado or Alaska.
