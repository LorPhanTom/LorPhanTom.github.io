    <p style="font-family:sans-serif;">My name is Anthony Leacock and am a CUTCO Sales Rep at Vector Marketing. I am a Student at Mizzou and am majoring in Business and Communication. I am an Eagle Scout, an avid writer, and I just started boxing earlier last year! My goal through this job is personal growth and transformation, to achieve a great income, and to help out my customers as well as my CUTCO team. <br> <br> There is a great quote that I always try to live by: <br> <br> "With <em>hard work</em> and <em>focus</em>, dreams <strong>do</strong> come true". <br> <br> I just started working at vector last December, but I am working hard to become the best sales rep possible and continue serving and growing my CUTCO family. Right now, I am working to get over $10,000 in sales--once that happens, I will get my big promotion! To do that, I am working to get 10 appointments every week, with about 40 a month. With this, I know I will achieve my goal. Over the summer I intend to become an Assistant Manager, and then the next summer open my own Branch Office and start my own  CUTCO office from scratch. But right now, before next February, my Big Goal is to sell over $100,000 worth of CUTCO!! This is a big goal, and it wonâ€™t be easy. But I know when I achieve it, I will be proud of myself, and I will have many more opportunities in Vector!<br> <br> But most importantly, I hope to have a great time with you during our demo, and to help serve your needs as is best for you.<br> <br> Hope to see you soon and Happy CUTO! &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
